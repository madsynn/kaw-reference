## The Unofficial Kingdoms At War (KAW) Reference Guide

<p class="message">
  This is another unofficial guide for the kingdoms at war video game!  I have spent many hours looking for information on how to pass or do things in the game and not find anything. You ask the more knowledgable players and they are either vaque with the answer or rude and call you a noob. Well I hope this will help you find the info you need. If its not here pm me at --madsynn-- or BEATGNU and ask me to add it and when I get a minute it will happen. Hope you guys like it.
