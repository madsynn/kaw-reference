PHASE 1:
First: Use item: Angels of Light   and Holy Wrath   on Haze of the Accursed [30,000]
This bar regenerates 600 points every 10 minutes.
Second: Attack and Assassinate Life to 75% [100%]

Phase 1/3 Completion: Feeding on the evil deep beneath, blackened leaves grow from the limbs of the ancient forest trees.

PHASE 2:
First: Use item: Angels of Light   and Holy Wrath   on Haze of the Accursed [30,000] and Use item: Locust Swarm   on Forests of Corruption [10,000]
The bar Haze of the Accursed regenerates 600 points every 5 minutes.
Second: Attack and Assassinate Life to 50% [75%]

Phase 2/3 Completion: Your scouts track Apheriun's steps to an ancient gated structure.

PHASE 3:
First: Attack and Assassinate Corrupt Guardians [500,000]
Second: Attack and Assassinate Life to 3% [50%]

Phase 3/3 Completion: The completion of the ceremony is upon you. The haze returns, as the trees once again come to life.

Half-Awakened State:
First: Wait and Test: You often must wait a certain amount of time for Apheriun to awake. Many call this "God Mode". During "God Mode", you cannot have any successful actions. "God Mode" typically lasts between 5-8 minutes and repeats every 5-8 minutes. Sometimes you enter the 3% stage in "God Mode", and some times you enter it in-between.
If you enter during "God Mode", you must "test" for it to be over.
To test, either Use Item: Locust Swarm or Angel of Light and Holy Wrath
Repeat every 30 seconds or so until you get a success.
Once you get a success the "God Mode" is over and you may proceed to step #2
Second: Use item: Angels of Light   and Holy Wrath   on Haze of the Accursed [15,000] and Use item: Locust Swarm   on Forests of Corruption [5,000]
The bar Haze of the Accursed regenerates 2,250 points every 6 minutes.
The bar Forests of Corruption regenerates 750 points every 6 minutes.
It is recommended to only have one person using the items here.
Use the items Angel of Light   and Holy Wrath   12 times, and use the item Locust Swarm   8 times (this seems to be the magic formula for lowering the bars together).
Then test to see if you can Attack and Assassinate Life. If you fail on the Attack and Assassinate, then repeat the above until you get a success. When you get a success, you have found the "Sweet Spot". Stop using items except to maintain this sweet spot percentage level on both bars.

Third: While holding both bars at the "Sweet Spot", Attack and Assassinate Life to 0% [3%]
This bar regenerates 1% every 6 minutes.
NOTE: If you overpin either of the item bars you have to wait for them to regenerate. This wait time will likely reset the stage. So start over at step 1 (testing for "God Mode").
